This is a simple project that I have been working on in python.
This will require the Discord.py library which can be installed using pip if pip is attached to your PATH:

pip install discord

If you have any recommendations, please don't hesitate to message me! This is a bit of fun but I'm always up for a challenge.
Oh and yeah, anyone can use this.
Just gimme a little bit of credit.
