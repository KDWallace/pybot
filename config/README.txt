The file "command locations.json" is not automatically generated and neither is the data inside. This is entered manually however commands will be added to change this in the future
The data inside is an example of the formatting for certain commands that can only be used in certain channels. This can be added to a command by using the has_channel_perms found in main.py
The "server","name" and "category" are not necessary. This is simply for ease of use for a user. The program does not use anything other than the "id"...so far
