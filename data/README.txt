In the above directories and in the "usage.json", you should find some example files that are generated by the program. You do not need anything except the directories as the are not automatically generated as of yet.

All logs generated are created with the format "Day-Month_Year.txt"
All Active polls generated are created with the format "poll(channel id).json". This is to only allow one poll for each channel and will raise an error if another is created without ending the previous poll
All Archived polls are created once an active poll has ended and is generated with the format "poll day-month-year time #channel name.json"
